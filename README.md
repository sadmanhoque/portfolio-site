# portfolio-site

React-static site setup to be an online portfolio

### Introduction

There are two react-sites here, one in the "example" dir and the other in "mainCode" dir. The example one is based on a tutorial from Mosh (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk) as a way for me to get started on the basics and kept separate so I can always use it as a reference.

The project is based on React, with the boiler plate made using:

`npm create vite@4.1.0`

Where the version was chosen to be the same as the tutorial, and then select React, and Typescript in the options presented by vite.

For CSS I am using bootstrap.
