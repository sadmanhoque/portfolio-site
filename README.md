# portfolio-site

React-static site setup to be an online portfolio

### Introduction

There are two react-sites here, one in the "react-template" dir and the other in "my-project" dir. The first one is based on a tutorial from Mosh (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk) as a way for me to get started on the basics and kept separate so I can always use it as a reference.

The project is based on React, with the boiler plate made using instructions on tailwind site for a new vite project https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

The CSS is primarily based on tailwind with custom colours.
